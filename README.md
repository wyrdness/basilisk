## Overview

The basilisk is a legendary reptile reputed to be the king of serpents, whose gaze or breath is lethally poisonous. In European tradition, it was described as a small snake with a crown-like crest on its head. Medieval accounts transformed it into a creature with a rooster's head and serpent's tail, often conflated with the cockatrice.

The basilisk's powers include a deadly gaze that turns victims to stone or kills instantly, poisonous breath that withers all vegetation, and the ability to split rocks. First described by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century CE as a North African serpent, the basilisk likely originated from exaggerated accounts of cobras (whose hoods resemble crowns) combined with fear of venomous snakes.

## Famous Legends

### Basilisk of Vienna (1212)

According to legend, a basilisk was discovered in a well in Vienna. The creature's deadly breath poisoned the water and killed anyone who approached. It was finally destroyed when a brave man lowered a mirror into the well, causing the basilisk to see its own reflection and die.

## Theories & Explanations

### Historical Basis Theories

1. **Cobra Misidentification** ⭐
   Based on Egyptian and North African cobras whose hoods resemble crowns.
   
   **Evidence**:
   - Cobra hood expands to resemble a crown
   - Geographic origin: Pliny described it from North Africa
   - Deadly venom matches descriptions
   - "King of serpents" title fits cobra behavior
   - Cobras can "stand" upright, enhancing fearsome appearance

2. **Viper Exaggeration**
   Exaggerated accounts of European vipers fueled by medieval fear.
   
   **Evidence**:
   - Local viper species in Europe
   - Fear-based storytelling and exaggeration
   - Medieval unfamiliarity with actual cobra anatomy

3. **Deadly Gaze Archetype**
   Represents universal fear of venomous serpents combined with "evil eye" beliefs.
   
   **Evidence**:
   - Parallels with Gorgon myths
   - Evil eye traditions across cultures
   - Psychological projection of serpent fear

## Harry Potter's Basilisk

### Modern Interpretation

J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* (1998) features a giant basilisk:

**Characteristics**:
- 60-foot-long serpent
- Bright green with venomous fangs
- Deadly stare (direct look = death; indirect = petrification)
- Killed by rooster's crow
- Vulnerable to own reflection

**Lore Additions**:

## Classical Accounts

### Pliny the Elder (77 CE)

From *Natural History*, Book VIII:

> "The basilisk serpent is produced in the province of Cyrenaica [Libya], being not more than twelve inches in length, and adorned with a bright white marking on the head like a sort of crown. It drives away all other serpents with its hiss... Its touch, and even its breath, scorches grass, kills bushes, and bursts rocks. Its effect on other animals is disastrous: it is believed that once one was killed with a spear by a man on horseback and the infection rising through the spear killed not only the rider but also the horse."

---

## Modern Status

The basilisk is universally recognized as a mythological creature with no biological basis. No credible sighting claims exist; the basilisk belongs entirely to folklore and symbolic tradition.

**Historical Basis**: 
- Likely based on cobra (hood resembles crown)
- Exaggerated viper accounts
- Medieval fear of serpents
- "Evil eye" superstitions
